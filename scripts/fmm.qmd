# Assess over dispersion

- approximate the original binomial distribution with the poisson distribution with parameter nﾃ用. This can be done if n is large (e.g. n>100) and p is small such that nﾃ用 <10. Here nﾃ用 is essentially the number of successes in the binomial distribution. 
- We can then assess overdispersion by calculating the variance of the observed number of successes and comparing it to the model variance (nﾃ用). If the observed variance is much larger than the model variance, then we can conclude that there is overdispersion.

# Fit fmm - VEM - estimate the NPMLE of the number of support points

# Assess gradient function to make sure that it is the NPMLE

# Classify data into components/clusters

# Test covariate on the components
